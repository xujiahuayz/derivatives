## Forward

A forward is

-   an OTC (over-the-counter) contract in which two counterparties agree, with zero money down, to buy / sell the UCL at a pre-agreed *forward price* at a given *delivery date* in the future

### Example

a forward contract to exchange 1m barrels of crude oil in 3 months at a forward price of USD 95/barrel

At the *delivery date*:

-   The buyer (Long) delivers: forward price USD 95m
-   The seller (Short) delivers: UL 1m barrels of crude oil

## Payoff of a forward

### Notations

$F$: forward price

$T$: delivery date

$S_T$: the spot price of the underlying on the delivery date

## Forwards vs Futures

Futures are **exchange-traded** version of forwards

|                          | **Forwards**       | **Futures**                               |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Buyer-seller interaction | Direct             | Via exchange                              |
| Default-risk borne by    | Individual parties | Exchange                                  |
| Default controlled by    | Collateral         | Margin accounts daily "marking to market" |
| Contract terms           | Tailored           | Standardized                              |
| Unilateral reversal      | Difficult          | Easy                                      |

## E-mini S&P 500 Index Futures Contract

Most popular equity index futures contract in the world

-   **Contract size**: \$50 $\times$ S&P 500 Index price (0.2 of the standard S&P 500 futures contract)
-   **Contract month**: March quarterly expiration cycle (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec)
-   **Trading hours**: CME Globex (essentially around the clock from Sunday evening to late Friday afternoon)
-   **Trading termination**: 8.30am on the Settlement Date (3rd Friday of the contract month)
-   **Settlement procedure**: Cash settlement based on the Special Opening Quotation on Friday morning of the S&P500 Index
-   **Position limits**: 20,000 S&P500 contracts or equivalent net long or short in all contract months combined

## Futures contracts - marking to market

-   Similar economic effect to forwards, but, due to **marking to market**, gains and losses on futures positions are settled each day

-   After **marking to market**, both sides have a zero value position with the new (end of day) futures price.

-   The long receives from (pays to) the short any increase (decrease) in the futures price from the previous day

| Date          | 0   | 1         | 2          | 3         | $T=4$     |
|---------------|-----|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Future price  | 106 | 108       | 104        | 105       | $S_T=107$ |
| Long receives | 0   | 108-106=2 | 104-108=-4 | 105-104=1 | 107-105=2 |

-   Note that $\sum(\text{cash flow long receives}) = 1$, equal to the payoff on a forward position where the forward price is the original futures price $S_T - F = 107-106 = 1$

## Fair forward price

-   Consider a stock

    -   currently traded at £40
    -   does not pay dividends
    -   with an expected return of 5% p.a.
    -   risk-free rate is 2% p.a.

-   How much would you **agree to** today, to pay to buy the stock a year from now?

(a) £40
(b) £40.8
(c) £42

## Arbitrage-free pricing

Replicate the same cashflow as a long forward contract by buying the stock today using borrowed money and repaying the borrowing with interest at $T$:

|                                        | Today | **Delivery date** $T$ |
|----------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------|
| **Long forward**                       | 0     | $S_T-F$               |
| "Cash and carry" replicating strategy: |       |                       |
| Buy stock today                        | $-40$ | $S_T$                 |
| Borrow £40 for 1 year at 2%            | $40$  | $-40.8$               |
| **Net**                                | 0     | $S_T-40.8$            |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fair forward price is 40.8; otherwise there is an arbitrage opportunity.

For example, if the actual forward price is quoted at 41.2

|                    |                             | Today | **Delivery date** $T$ |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------|-----------------------|
| **Buy low:**       | Buy stock today             | $-40$ | $S_T$                 |
|                    | Borrow £40 for 1 year at 2% | 40    | $-40.8$               |
|                    | Net                         | 0     | $S_T-40.8$            |
|                    |                             |       |                       |
| **Sell high:**     | Short forward               | 0     | $41.2-S_T$            |
|                    |                             |       |                       |
| **Net cash flows** |                             | 0     | £0.4                  |
