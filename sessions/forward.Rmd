## Forwards vs Futures

Futures are **exchange-traded** version of forwards


|                          | **Forwards**       | **Futures**                               |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Buyer-seller interaction | Direct             | Via exchange                              |
| Default-risk borne by    | Individual parties | Exchange                                  |
| Default controlled by    | Collateral         | Margin accounts daily "marking to market" |
| Contract terms           | Tailored           | Standardized                              |
| Unilateral reversal      | Difficult          | Easy                                      |
